# Icon Assets

This directory should contain:

- `icon.ico` - Windows tray icon (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 recommended)
- `iconTemplate.png` - macOS menu bar icon (22x22 @1x, 44x44 @2x recommended, with transparency)

For now, placeholder icons are not included. The app will work with Electron's default icons.

To add custom icons:
1. Create or obtain icon files
2. Place them in this directory
3. Rebuild the app with `npm run dist`
