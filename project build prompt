You are a senior Electron developer. Build a complete, working cross-platform Electron tray/menu-bar app named "SwiftBeGone" for macOS + Windows.

Goal
- SwiftBeGone runs in the background (tray on Windows, menu bar on macOS).
- It detects the currently playing artist, and if it matches the blocked list (default includes "Taylor Swift"), it automatically skips to the next track.
- MVP is “skip only” (no mute).

Branding / Identity (must be consistent everywhere)
- Product name: SwiftBeGone
- AppId / Bundle ID: com.swiftbegone.app
- Tooltip: SwiftBeGone
- Repo link: https://github.com/swiftbegone/swiftbegonesongskip
- Website/help link: https://swiftbegone.xyz
- Donate link: https://buymeacoffee.com/swiftbegone?new=1
- Extension placeholder link: https://swiftbegone.xyz/#extension

Scope (MVP)
- No audio fingerprinting. Do NOT record or capture mic/system audio.
- No big UI window. Tray/menu-bar only.
- Support:
  1) Spotify (macOS + Windows) via Spotify Web API + OAuth
  2) Apple Music (macOS only) via AppleScript controlling the Music app
- On Windows, if Spotify is not connected/playing, just show Idle (we will add Windows media session later).

Tray/Menu UI requirements
- Tray/menu context menu must show:
  - A header line: "SwiftBeGone — ON" or "SwiftBeGone — OFF" (disabled, informational)
  - A Status line (disabled, informational) that updates continuously:
    - When Spotify is playing: "Spotify: <Artists> — <Track>"
    - On macOS, when Spotify is not playing and Apple Music is playing: "Apple Music: <Artist> — <Track>"
    - Otherwise: "Idle"
  - Toggle item: Enable/Disable (when OFF, app does not skip)
  - Spotify item: "Connect Spotify…" (only shown/enabled when not connected). When connected, show "Spotify: Connected" (disabled).
  - Links:
    - "Help / Setup…" opens https://swiftbegone.xyz
    - "Install Browser Extension…" opens https://swiftbegone.xyz/#extension
    - "Donate…" opens https://buymeacoffee.com/swiftbegone?new=1
    - "GitHub…" opens https://github.com/swiftbegone/swiftbegonesongskip
  - Quit

Persistence / settings
- Use electron-store for persistence.
- Store keys:
  - enabled: boolean (default true)
  - blocked_artists: array of strings (default ["Taylor Swift"])
  - spotify_client_id: string
  - spotify_client_secret: string
  - spotify_refresh_token: string
  - spotify_access_token: string
  - spotify_token_expires_at: number (ms epoch)
- Provide helper functions:
  - normalizeName(str) => trimmed + lowercase
  - sanitizeBlockedList(list) => removes blanks, dedupes
  - isBlockedArtist(artistName, blockedArtists) => exact match using normalizeName

Matching rules
- Case-insensitive, trimmed EXACT match against blocked_artists entries.
- For Spotify, if ANY artist on the track matches blocked list => skip.
- Cooldown: after any skip, do not skip again for 2.5 seconds (avoid repeated skips).

Polling rules
- Poll every ~1.0–1.2 seconds.
- Priority order:
  1) If Spotify connected AND Spotify is currently playing -> use Spotify now playing and skip via Spotify API if blocked.
  2) Else if macOS and Apple Music (Music app) is running AND playing -> use AppleScript now playing and skip via AppleScript if blocked.
  3) Else status is Idle.
- If app is disabled, do not skip; status can still update or show Disabled (either is fine, but do not skip).

Spotify integration requirements
- Implement Spotify OAuth Authorization Code flow with local callback server:
  - Callback server binds to 127.0.0.1 port 24863
  - Redirect URI must be exactly: http://127.0.0.1:24863/callback
- Scopes required:
  - user-read-playback-state
  - user-modify-playback-state
- Use the following endpoints:
  - GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing
  - POST https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/next
- Refresh access tokens automatically using refresh token.
- Error handling:
  - If Spotify returns 204 (nothing playing), treat as not playing.
  - If token refresh fails, status should show a short error but app should continue running.

Apple Music (macOS) integration requirements
- Use AppleScript via osascript.
- Read now playing artist + track:
  - If Music is running and player state is playing -> get artist of current track and name of current track.
  - Else treat as not playing.
- Skip:
  - tell application "Music" to next track
- Expect macOS to prompt for automation permission; handle errors gracefully in status.

Project / output requirements
- Provide a full repo layout with these files:
  - package.json with scripts:
    - "dev": "electron ."
    - "dist": "electron-builder"
  - src/main.js (Electron main process, tray/menu, polling)
  - src/spotify.js (OAuth helpers, API calls, refresh)
  - src/oauthServer.js (express server for callback)
  - src/appleMusic.js (osascript helper)
  - src/blocklist.js (normalize/sanitize/isBlocked)
  - assets/icon.ico for Windows (placeholder ok)
  - assets/iconTemplate.png for macOS (placeholder ok)
- Use electron-builder config in package.json:
  - appId: com.swiftbegone.app
  - productName: SwiftBeGone
- Include clear setup instructions in a README:
  - How to install dependencies and run in dev
  - How to create a Spotify developer app
  - Where to paste spotify_client_id/spotify_client_secret for MVP (can be stored via electron-store defaults or environment variables)
  - How to build installers with npm run dist

Important constraints
- Do NOT build a large renderer UI window for MVP.
- Do NOT omit required files.
- Return the complete file tree first, then the full contents of each file.

Acceptance tests (must pass logically)
1) If SwiftBeGone is OFF, it never skips any track.
2) If Spotify is playing a track with artist "Taylor Swift", SwiftBeGone calls Spotify Next Track and waits for cooldown.
3) On macOS, if Music app is playing "Taylor Swift" and Spotify is not playing, SwiftBeGone runs AppleScript next track.
4) Tray status accurately updates with the current source and now playing info.

Deliverable format
- Output the project as multiple files with correct code. Do not include pseudocode. Use real code with basic error handling and comments.
